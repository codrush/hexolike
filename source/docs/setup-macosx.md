# Donload 
please download the wallet installation package from Metaverseâ€™s official website [https://mvs.org](https://mvs.org). The wallet is now support macOS Sierra and macOS High Sierra.

There are standard and data packet versions of the installation package. The packet version comes with a database, which greatly reduces the time required for initial block syncing. We recommend that new users download and install this version; old users are recommended to install the standard version, because the packet version may write over some raw data. Please choose the appropriate installation package.

# Install
Double-click the installation file and follow the prompts to complete installation. Click Launchpad to view the wallet program and double-click the wallet icon. Then, find the wallet icon in taskbar at the top of your screen and click the "Open Metaverse" command to enter the wallet login page.
