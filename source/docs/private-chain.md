title: Build Private Chains

## Refer to [Compiling] and [options]
With reference to the above document, we can build private chains based on Metaverse by setting configuration files without the need to change the code.


```bash
# mvs configuration file exmaple

[network]
# The magic number for message headers
identifier = 0x6d73766d
# The port for incoming connections, defaults to 5251 (15251 for testnet).
inbound_port = 5251
```

By modifying the `identifier`, we can implement different blockchain instances.
Developers donâ€™t have to be worried even it runs in the main network mode, because block generation speed is very fast and they can use the CPU to continue mining test.
