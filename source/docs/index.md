### Receiving ETP

### Query transaction hash
Metaverse Wallet provides a portion of the block explorer’s functions. Users can inquire about blocks, transactions or the details of an address through querying the block’s serial number, the transaction hash and the address respectively. Each transaction produces a hash. You may view a transaction’s details via querying its transaction hash.

# Metaverse full node wallet introduction
Full nodes are nodes that store the entire Metaverse blockchain and are connected in a P2P network architecture. In the blockchain network, all full nodes are treated as equals, and serve as both clients and servers. 

The MVS full node consists of two programs and a graphical interface:
•   mvsd: The core wallet program, similar to Bitcoin’s bitcoind;
•   mvs-cli: a command line interface, similar to Bitcoin’s bitcoin-cli
•   mvs-htmls: a browser-based graphical user interface built with AngularJS. This GUI may not be necessary for developers.
